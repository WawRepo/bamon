## Why BAMON?

Countless monitoring tools exist, but BAMON fills a specific gap. We all have those commands we run in the terminal just to check something - maybe a GitHub status check, SSH to a dev VM to check load, or in my case, getting a full overview of multiple ArgoCD applications.

The goal of BAMON is simple: when you have a command or script you'd like to run in a repetitive manner, that just needs the context of your user environment, BAMON is the tool for you.
