- License information
```

2. Include detailed code examples for each command:
```bash
# Adding a new script to monitor
bamon add check_disk --command="df -h / | awk 'NR==2 {print \$5}'" --interval=300 --description="Check disk usage every 5 minutes"

# Removing a script
bamon remove check_disk

# Starting the daemon
bamon start --daemon

# Checking status
bamon status
```

3. Create a troubleshooting section with common issues:
```markdown
## Troubleshooting

### Daemon fails to start
- Check if another instance is already running: `bamon status`
- Verify permissions on configuration directory: `ls -la ~/.config/bamon/`
- Check logs for specific errors: `cat /var/log/bamon.log`

### Scripts not executing
- Verify script is enabled: `bamon list`
- Check script syntax: `bash -n your_script.sh`
- Review execution logs: `bamon logs --script=script_name`
```

4. Include a complete API reference table:
```markdown
| Command | Description | Options | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|---------|
| add | Add a new script to monitor | --command, --interval, --description, --disabled | `bamon add check_disk --command="df -h /" --interval=300` |
| remove | Remove a script from monitoring | --force | `bamon remove check_disk --force` |
| list | List all monitored scripts | --format, --filter | `bamon list --format=json` |
| start | Start the daemon | --daemon, --config | `bamon start --daemon` |
| stop | Stop the daemon | --force | `bamon stop` |
| restart | Restart the daemon | --force | `bamon restart` |
| status | Check daemon status | --format | `bamon status` |
| logs | View daemon logs | --follow, --lines, --script | `bamon logs --follow --lines=50` |
```

5. Create an installation verification section:
```markdown
### Verifying Installation

After installation, verify BAMON is working correctly:

1. Check the service status:
   ```
   systemctl status bamon
   ```

2. Verify the configuration file exists:
   ```
   cat /etc/bamon/config.yaml
   ```

3. Test adding a simple script:
   ```
   bamon add test_script --command="echo 'Hello, BAMON!'" --interval=60
   ```

4. Check if the script appears in the list:
   ```
   bamon list
   ```

5. View logs to confirm execution:
   ```
   bamon logs --script=test_script
   ```
```

6. Ensure the README includes information about security considerations:
```markdown
## Security Considerations

- BAMON executes scripts in a sandboxed environment with resource limitations
- Scripts run with the permissions of the user who started the daemon
- Sensitive information should not be included directly in script commands
- Use environment variables or secure credential storage for sensitive data
- Consider running BAMON with a dedicated user with minimal permissions
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify README.md content is complete and accurate:
   - Ensure all sections listed in the implementation details are present
   - Check that all commands and options are documented correctly
   - Verify examples match the actual implementation

2. Test README.md formatting:
   - Validate markdown syntax using a markdown linter
   - Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1 > h2 > h3)
   - Check that code blocks are properly formatted with appropriate language tags
   - Verify tables are correctly formatted and aligned

3. Validate technical accuracy:
   - Cross-reference command documentation with actual implementation
   - Ensure all command options are documented with correct syntax
   - Verify installation instructions work on a clean system
   - Test troubleshooting steps to confirm they resolve the issues they claim to address

4. Review for completeness:
   - Ensure all CLI commands are documented
   - Verify all configuration options are explained
   - Check that common error scenarios have troubleshooting guidance
   - Confirm that security considerations are adequately addressed

5. Usability testing:
   - Have a team member unfamiliar with the project follow the README instructions
   - Note any points of confusion or missing information
   - Verify they can successfully install and use the tool following only the README

6. Accessibility and readability:
   - Check for clear language and avoid unnecessary jargon
   - Ensure examples are easy to understand
   - Verify proper use of formatting to enhance readability
   - Check that diagrams and visual elements have appropriate text descriptions
