# Task ID: 30
# Title: Implement Performance Optimization and Monitoring
# Status: cancelled
# Dependencies: 25, 26, 27
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the performance monitoring and optimization system to manage system load and resource usage.
# Details:
1. Implement the performance.sh library with the following features:
   - System load monitoring using /proc/loadavg or uptime command
   - CPU, memory, and disk usage tracking
   - Adaptive scheduling based on system performance
   - Resource usage tracking per script
2. Implement the performance_command.sh:
   - Display system performance metrics
   - Show optimization status and settings
   - Include script-specific performance data
   - Support for enabling/disabling performance optimization
3. Create concurrent execution management:
   - Limit number of simultaneously running scripts
   - Implement queue for scripts when system is at capacity
   - Add priority scheduling for high-priority scripts
4. Implement adaptive scheduling:
   - Adjust execution intervals based on system load
   - Skip executions during high load periods
   - Resume normal scheduling when load decreases
5. Add performance metrics collection:
   - Track execution times for each script
   - Monitor success/failure rates
   - Track resource usage (CPU, memory, time)
   - Calculate averages and trends
6. Implement configuration options for performance settings:
   - load_threshold for determining high load
   - max_concurrent for limiting simultaneous executions
   - optimize_scheduling for enabling/disabling optimization

# Test Strategy:
1. Test system load monitoring under various conditions
2. Verify concurrent execution limits are enforced
3. Test adaptive scheduling during high load
4. Verify performance metrics collection
5. Test performance command output
6. Verify queue management for scripts
7. Test priority scheduling for high-priority scripts
8. Verify configuration options affect behavior correctly
9. Test with various system load scenarios
10. Verify resource usage tracking per script
