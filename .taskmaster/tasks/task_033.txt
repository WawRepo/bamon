# Task ID: 33
# Title: Create GitHub Workflows for CI/CD and Release Automation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 25, 31
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration testing and automated release management, including version control and asset packaging.
# Details:
1. Create the GitHub workflow directory structure:
   ```
   .github/
   └── workflows/
       ├── ci.yml
       └── release.yml
   ```

2. Implement the CI workflow (ci.yml) with the following features:
   - Configure workflow to trigger on push to main branch and pull requests
   - Set up Ubuntu latest runner environment
   - Install required dependencies (bash, curl, yq, jq, coreutils, bats, docker)
   - Check out repository with fetch-depth: 0 for complete history
   - Binary generation using bashly
   - Run container-based tests using Docker
   - Execute the test suite with proper error reporting (BATS tests + container tests)
   - Installation script validation
   - CLI command testing
   - Cache dependencies to speed up workflow runs
   - Add status badges to README.md

3. Implement the release workflow (release.yml) with the following features:
   - Configure manual trigger using workflow_dispatch
   - Add inputs for version bump type (patch/minor/major)
   - Add dry run capability for testing
   - Set up Ubuntu latest runner environment
   - Install required dependencies (bash, curl, yq, jq, coreutils, bashly)
   - Check out repository with fetch-depth: 0 for complete history
   - Implement version detection logic:
     - Fetch all git tags
     - Extract highest semantic version tag using `git describe --tags --abbrev=0`
     - Increment version according to semver rules (patch by default)
   - Update version in bashly.yml configuration
   - Regenerate binary using bashly generate
   - Create git tag with new version
   - Package release assets:
     - bamon binary
     - install.sh script
     - docs/ directory
     - samples/ directory
     - tests/ directory
   - Create GitHub release with all assets
   - Push changes back to repository

4. Add GitHub token permissions configuration:
   - contents: write (for creating releases and tags)
   - packages: read (for dependency access)
   - actions: read (for workflow runs)

5. Implement error handling and notifications:
   - Add failure notifications via GitHub notifications
   - Implement detailed error reporting in workflow logs
   - Add retry logic for network-dependent steps

6. Document workflows in README.md:
   - Add section explaining CI/CD process
   - Include instructions for manual release triggering
   - Document version bumping process

# Test Strategy:
1. Test CI workflow functionality:
   - Make a test commit to main branch and verify workflow triggers automatically
   - Create a pull request and confirm tests run on PR
   - Intentionally break a test and verify the workflow fails appropriately
   - Check that status badges update correctly
   - Verify binary generation works correctly
   - Test installation script validation
   - Confirm CLI command testing works as expected

2. Test release workflow functionality:
   - Manually trigger the release workflow with patch version bump
   - Test the dry run capability to verify workflow without creating actual releases
   - Verify version detection correctly identifies the highest existing tag
   - Confirm version in bashly.yml is updated correctly
   - Validate that binary is regenerated with updated version
   - Check that git tag is created with correct version format (v1.2.3)
   - Verify all required assets are included in the GitHub release
   - Test downloading assets from the release and verify integrity

3. Test error handling:
   - Simulate network failure during dependency installation
   - Verify retry logic works as expected
   - Test with invalid version format and verify appropriate error message

4. Test permissions and security:
   - Verify workflow runs with minimal required permissions
   - Confirm secure handling of GitHub token
   - Test that workflow cannot be triggered by unauthorized users

5. Test in different environments:
   - Verify release assets work on Ubuntu, macOS, and WSL2
   - Test installation script from release assets
   - Validate documentation accuracy for release process
