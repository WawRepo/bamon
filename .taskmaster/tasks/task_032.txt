# Task ID: 32
# Title: Implement CI/CD and Release Automation
# Status: cancelled
# Dependencies: 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up GitHub workflows for continuous integration, testing, and automated release management.
# Details:
1. Create GitHub workflow files:
   - ci.yml for continuous integration
   - release.yml for release automation
2. Implement CI workflow with the following features:
   - Trigger on commits to main branch
   - Run tests in Ubuntu container environment
   - Install dependencies (bash, curl, yq, coreutils)
   - Execute test suite
   - Report status to GitHub PR/commit
3. Implement release workflow:
   - Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)
   - Version detection and bumping
   - Update version in bashly.yml
   - Regenerate binary with bashly
   - Create git tag with new version
   - Package release assets
   - Create GitHub release with assets and notes
4. Implement version management:
   - Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
   - Automated patch bumping
   - Git tag format with 'v' prefix (e.g., v0.1.0)
5. Set up release asset packaging:
   - Include bamon binary
   - Include install.sh script
   - Include documentation and samples
   - Include tests
6. Create test environment in Ubuntu container:
   - Fresh Ubuntu container (latest LTS)
   - Install dependencies
   - Run installation script
   - Execute test suite
7. Implement BATS (Bash Automated Testing System) tests:
   - Command functionality tests
   - Daemon execution tests
   - Configuration management tests
   - Performance monitoring tests
   - Installation tests

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify CI workflow runs on commits to main branch
2. Test release workflow with manual trigger
3. Verify version bumping works correctly
4. Test binary regeneration with bashly
5. Verify git tag creation
6. Test release asset packaging
7. Verify GitHub release creation
8. Test in Ubuntu container environment
9. Verify BATS tests run correctly
10. Test installation from release assets
