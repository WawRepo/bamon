# Task ID: 26
# Title: Implement Logging System and Daemon Process Management
# Status: cancelled
# Dependencies: 25
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the logging system with configurable levels and implement daemon process management functionality.
# Details:
1. Implement the logging.sh library with the following features:
   - Support for configurable log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
   - Log rotation functionality to prevent disk space issues
   - Functions for logging to both console and file
   - Timestamp and log level prefixing
   - Support for redirecting both stdout and stderr to log file in daemon mode
2. Implement daemon process management:
   - Create functions to start the daemon in background mode
   - Implement PID file management for tracking the daemon process
   - Create stop functionality to terminate the daemon gracefully
   - Implement restart functionality
   - Add signal handling for graceful shutdown (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
3. Set up log file location at ~/.config/bamon/daemon.log (configurable)
4. Implement foreground mode (without --daemon flag) that outputs to terminal
5. Create functions to check daemon status (running/stopped)
6. Implement proper error handling for daemon management operations
7. Use 'nohup' and output redirection (2>&1) for background operation
8. Add log rotation based on file size or time interval
9. Implement log level filtering based on configuration

# Test Strategy:
1. Test logging at different log levels
2. Verify log rotation works when log file reaches size limit
3. Test daemon start in both foreground and background modes
4. Verify PID file is created and managed correctly
5. Test daemon stop and verify process is terminated
6. Test restart functionality
7. Verify signal handling for graceful shutdown
8. Test log output redirection in daemon mode
9. Verify error handling for various failure scenarios
10. Test log level filtering based on configuration
