# BAMON Documentation

Welcome to the BAMON documentation! BAMON (Bash Daemon Monitor) is a tool for monitoring and executing bash scripts at specified intervals.

## Why BAMON?

Countless monitoring tools exist, but BAMON fills a specific gap. We all have those commands we run in the terminal just to check something - maybe a GitHub status check, SSH to a dev VM to check load, or in my case, getting a full overview of multiple non production ArgoCD applications.

The goal of BAMON is simple: when you have a command or script you'd like to run in a repetitive manner, that just needs the context of your user environment, BAMON is the tool for you.

## What is BAMON?

BAMON is a lightweight, configurable monitoring solution that runs as a daemon process, continuously monitoring configured scripts and executing them at specified intervals. It provides:

- **Automated Script Execution**: Run scripts at configurable intervals
- **Sandboxed Environment**: Secure execution with resource limits
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in system metrics and optimization
- **Flexible Configuration**: YAML-based configuration with CLI management
- **Comprehensive Status**: Detailed execution history and status reporting

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Download and install from latest release

### Basic Usage
